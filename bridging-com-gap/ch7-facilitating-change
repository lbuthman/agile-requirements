- Treat defects (bugs) as missing tests. Why was it not caught in the first place? Which set of tests would have caught it?
To be clear, the bug can mean different things, so understanding it and what it really means is a communicaiton opportunity.

- As the code base changes and develops, acceptance tests should undergo housekeeping to remain flexible, useful, and relevant.

- Common symptoms to watch out for in tests
  * Long tests, especially if they check several rules
  * Parameters of calculation tests that always have the same values
  * Similar tests with minor differences
  * Tests that reflect/mimick how the code was written
  * Parts of tests are used to set-up other tests
  * Interdependent tests
