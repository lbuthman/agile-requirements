- Merely expressing specifications via realistic examples instead of abstract sentences is not enough; the
team needs to have open discussions and ensure everyone understands the same thing.

- The problem with BA's acting as business proxies is that they try to answer questions themselves, rather than
inquiring with the business.

- If a customer representative/domain expert is not available, be sure to go through examples and cases when
they are.

- Sometimes a business person will appear bored; this is a warning sign of at least two possible issues:
  1) The example is not realistic or important to the system.
  2) You are not talking to the right person. They have no interest or expertise with the given topic and you 
  need to find someone who does.
  
- During workshops, keep the flow going by focusing on what and why, not how it needs to be implemented.

- Feedback exercises include Ambiguity Polls and Planning Poker, aimed at uncovering gaps or opportunities for the
effort. Another exercise is for a person to provide a case that is normal and then someone else says an unexpected
event. Everyone writes down how they think the team should react and then compare their results. This will shine
light on whether everyone is on the same page or not, unmasking assumptions, etc.
