- Build the project the right way and build the right project.

1) Deriving scope from goals
  -> business user's focus on communicating the intent of the desired feature and the value they expect to get from it. The

2) Specifying collaboratively
  -> create a collective ownership of the specification by not relying on a single person to get the specification right
  in isolation
3) Illustrating using examples
